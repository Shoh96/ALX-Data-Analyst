# Gapminder Data Analysis

In this project it is going to be analyzed the data associated with [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/), an independent Swedish foundation that fights devastating misconceptions about global development. In particular, the goal of this project is to find trends among countries that have significantly improved their educational level in recent years and how this improvement relates to wealth, population density, CO2 emissions associated to fossil fuels and human development index.

# Data

The data to be used are the following:

- **Mean years of school until 25-34 years old**
Average number of years of school attended by all people in the age and gender group specified, including primary, secondary and tertiary education.

- **GDP/person**
Gross Domestic Product per person adjusted for differences in purchasing power (in international dollars, fixed 2011 PPP based on 2011 ICP).

- **Population density**
Average number of people on each square km of land in the given country.

- **CO2 emissions/person**
Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels (Metric tonnes of C02 per person).

- **Human development index**
Human Development Index is an index used to rank countries by level of "human development". It contains three dimensions: health level, educational level and living standard.


# Conclusion


- A **general increase trend** in the mean of all the variables is observed in a linear manner with two exceptions. GDP per capita has decreased in 2008, this could be explained by the financial crisis, and has resumed the incremental trend in 2009. CO2 emissions per capita have increased until 2008 and have started to fluctuate with a slightly decreasing trend since then.

- The **greatest increase in GDP** per capita has been observed in the countries with the **lowest incomes**.

- A **strong correlation of education with GDP** per capita (R = 0.54) and a **moderate correlation between education and CO2 emissions** per capita (R = 0.44) have been observed. This difference could leave room for more advanced research to understand how to improve economically without increasing pollution.

- Among the countries with more than 14 years of average education duration, it has been observed that **Sweden could be a model to follow in the green transition** as it shows a very high GDP per capita and low CO2 emissions.
